Telecom Churn Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using the service, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

Introduction
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to maintain their customer base. In this project, we use various machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on historical data. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Data
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers of a telecom company. The features include demographic information, account information, and service usage patterns. The target variable is whether the customer has churned or not.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, roc_auc_score

Modeling
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Encode categorical variables
Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler
Model Training
We used two machine learning models for this project:

Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Both models were trained using the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering included creating new features based on existing ones to improve model performance.

Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC AUC Score
We also used confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves for a detailed evaluation.
